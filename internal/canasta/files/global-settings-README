# Global Settings Directory

This directory contains PHP configuration files that apply to ALL wikis in your
Canasta installation. Files are loaded automatically in lexicographic order.

## Load Order

All .php files in this directory are loaded automatically in lexicographic order.
You can optionally use numeric prefixes to control load order:

    10-MySkin.php
    50-Extensions.php
    90-Footer.php

But plain names work fine:

    Vector.php
    CanastaFooterIcon.php
    MyExtensions.php

## What to Configure Here

- wfLoadExtension() / wfLoadSkin() calls
- Default $wgLanguageCode, $wgDefaultSkin, etc.
- Permission settings ($wgGroupPermissions)
- Any setting that should be the same across all wikis

## Variables Set Automatically

Do NOT set these here (they are configured automatically from wikis.yaml):

- $wgDBname — set to the wiki ID
- $wgServer — set from the wiki's URL
- $wgSitename — set from the wiki's "name" field (defaults to wiki ID)
- $wgMetaNamespace — derived from display name with spaces replaced by underscores
  (can be overridden in per-wiki settings)

## Per-Wiki Overrides

For wiki-specific settings, add files to:

    config/settings/wikis/<wiki_id>/

Per-wiki settings are loaded AFTER global settings and can override them.

## Notes

- All .php files in this directory are loaded automatically
- Files without the .php extension (like this README) are ignored
