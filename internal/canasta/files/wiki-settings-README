# Per-Wiki Settings Directory: {WIKI_ID}

This directory contains PHP configuration files specific to this wiki.
Files are loaded automatically in alphabetical order, AFTER global settings.

## File Naming Convention

Use two-digit numeric prefixes (00-99) to control load order. For example:

    00-first.php   # Loaded first (within this wiki's directory)
    50-logo.php    # Loaded in the middle
    99-final.php   # Loaded last (final overrides)

## What to Configure Here

- Wiki-specific $wgLanguageCode
- Wiki-specific $wgLogo
- Wiki-specific extensions or skins (wfLoadExtension, wfLoadSkin)
- Any setting that should differ from global defaults

## Variables Set Automatically

Do NOT set these here (they are configured automatically from wikis.yaml):

- $wgDBname
- $wgServer
- $wgSitename
- $wgMetaNamespace

## Global Settings

For settings that apply to ALL wikis, add files to:

    config/settings/global/

## Notes

- All .php files in this directory are loaded automatically
- Per-wiki settings override global settings with the same variable
- Files without the .php extension (like this README) are ignored
