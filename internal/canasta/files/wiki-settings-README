# Per-Wiki Settings Directory: {WIKI_ID}

This directory contains PHP configuration files specific to this wiki.
Files are loaded automatically in lexicographic order, AFTER global settings.

## Load Order

All .php files in this directory are loaded automatically in lexicographic order.
You can optionally use numeric prefixes to control load order:

    10-first.php   # Loaded first (within this wiki's directory)
    50-logo.php    # Loaded in the middle
    90-final.php   # Loaded last (final overrides)

But plain names work fine:

    Logo.php
    Permissions.php

## What to Configure Here

- Wiki-specific $wgLanguageCode
- Wiki-specific $wgLogo
- Wiki-specific extensions or skins (wfLoadExtension, wfLoadSkin)
- Any setting that should differ from global defaults

## Variables Set Automatically

Do NOT set these here unless you need to override the default:

- $wgDBname — set to the wiki ID (do NOT override)
- $wgServer — set from the wiki's URL (do NOT override)
- $wgSitename — set from the wiki's "name" field in wikis.yaml (do NOT override;
  change the "name" field in wikis.yaml instead)
- $wgMetaNamespace — derived from the display name with spaces replaced by
  underscores; override here if you want a different Project namespace name

## Global Settings

For settings that apply to ALL wikis, add files to:

    config/settings/global/

## Notes

- All .php files in this directory are loaded automatically
- Per-wiki settings override global settings with the same variable
- Files without the .php extension (like this README) are ignored
